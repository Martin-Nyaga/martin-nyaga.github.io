  <p class="mb-6">
    I'm a software engineer with over a decade of
    experience building applications for the web.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6">
    I wrote my first line of code in 2010. I've since taken dozens of
    web apps from conception to production, becoming fluent in a broad range
    of web technologies along the way.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6">
    I've shipped a lot of Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Typescript, and C++. More
    recently, I've been building with WebAssembly, focusing on how it expands
    the browser's capabilities. I've been especially interested in 
    <InlineLink target="_blank" href="https://drs.software/blog/understanding-webassembly---the-fundamentals/">
    porting applications to the browser using WebAssembly.</InlineLink>
    I’m constantly tinkering with new (to me) tech.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6">
    I’m currently the Lead Software Engineer at 
    <InlineLink target="_blank" href="https://drs.software/">DRS Software</InlineLink>,
    where we build advanced web applications and support organisations in
    modernising their existing software using Wasm.
