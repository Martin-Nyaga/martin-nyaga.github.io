  <h1 class="text-3xl sm:text-5xl mt-28 sm:mt-30 mb-12 font-bold">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Martin</h1>
  <p class="mb-6">
    I'm a software engineer with over a decade of
    experience building applications for the web.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6">
    I wrote my first line of code in 2010. I've since taken dozens of
    web apps from conception to production, becoming fluent in a broad range
    of web technologies along the way.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6">
    I've shipped a lot of Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Typescript, and C++. More
    recently, I've been building with WebAssembly, focusing on how it expands
    the browser's capabilities. I've been especially interested in porting
    applications to the browser using WebAssembly. Iâ€™m constantly tinkering with
    new (to me) tech.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Iâ€™m currently the Lead Software Engineer at 
  <a class="text-red-500 dark:text-red-400" href="https://drs.software/">DRS Software</a>,
    where we build advanced web applications and support organisations in
    modernising their existing software using Wasm.
