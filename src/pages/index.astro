  <p class="mb-6">
    HelloðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Martin, a software engineer with over a decade of
    experience building applications for the web.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6">
    I wrote my first line of code in 2010, and have since taken dozens of
    web apps from conception to production, becoming fluent in a broad range
    of web technologies along the way.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6">
    I've shipped a lot of Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Typescript, and C++. Iâ€™m a huge
    fan of WebAssembly too, and have tackled multiple interesting projects in
    that area. Iâ€™m constantly tinkering with new (to me)
    tech.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Iâ€™m currently the Lead Software Engineer at DRS Software, where we
    consult with businesses to solve interesting and complex problems with
    software.
  </p>
